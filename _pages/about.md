Introduction
=====
I am currently an R&D Engineer working at Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 
I am mainly responsible for developing Android TV C++ middleware. This part primarily deals with the communication mechanism between the Java and HAL layers, as well as various features of Android TV. Before my R&D position, I studied applied cryptography and information security at the Information Security Laboratory of National Sun Yat-sen University. I was fortunate to be directed by professor [Chun-I Fan](https://cifan.g-mail.nsysu.edu.tw/).
